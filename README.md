# Mental-Health-in-Tech-Workspace

Daily life involves natural fluctuations, influenced by various factors. However, when the ratio of these fluctuations becomes imbalanced, it can lead to mental and physical burnout, disrupting life's equilibrium and potentially resulting in Anxiety & Depression.
We are trying to analyse what influences most for the mental health issues people face in a Tech workspace with the help of the data collected by OSMI.

This project invoolves EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of the Survey by OSMI.

Some questions explored:

1. How does the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location?
2. What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?

Insights Found:

-The mental health survey has helped us to understand the mental condition of employees working in tech firms across countries

-A total of 1259 entries were recorded during the survey out of which 1007 were recorded from the top 3 countries.

-The United States leads the chart in terms of participation in the survey followed by the United Kingdom and Canada.

-45% OF males, 69% of females, and 79% of trans were found to have sought treatment concerning the overall survey.

-Likewise, data indicates that 48% of males, 71% of females, and 80% of trans individuals have received treatment within the top three countries in the recorded dataset.

-The following set of parameters are found to be affecting mental health the most and thus requires treatment:

1.Age

2.Family history,

3.Work Interference,

4.Number of employees working in a company

-New Zealand and Australia lead in prioritizing the resolution of employees' mental health issues, encouraging a higher number of individuals to seek treatment, followed by the United States and Canada.
